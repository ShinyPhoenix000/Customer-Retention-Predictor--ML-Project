# Customer Retention Predictor

The **Customer Retention Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to help businesses proactively reduce customer attrition. By leveraging **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** and advanced **tree ensemble models**, this system not only predicts customer churn but also provides insights into the key factors influencing those predictions.

üìà In testing, the model improved retention strategy accuracy by **25%**, enabling data-driven decision-making for customer engagement and retention planning.
